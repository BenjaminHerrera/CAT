CAT (Cryptocurrency Auto Trader)
================================

<br/>

Description
-----------

CAT is a light program that trades cryptocurrencies based on market indicators and behavior.
For now, CAT can only do a limited number of actions such as deciding whether to enter a market or communicating with its trading platform.
The only trading platform it can communicate and interact with is with HitBTC ([Link to the Platform](https://HitBTC.com))

Roadmap
-------

~~CAT is just a small pilot project. Future versions of CAT will be uploaded to GitHub, but development might be slow or nonexistent.
In the future, I plan to add more features such as more control over the program's settings, AI, GUI, etc.~~

__EDIT: Support of CAT's development has ended. This is due to HitBTC's change in terms of service with US-based users. Since I reside in the US, I cannot test CAT's functionality and performance. However, I will be looking for a another trading platform (presumbly outside of the cryptocurrency world and more into stocks, futures, bonds, etc.) For the meantime, v0.6.0 will be CAT's last version.__
